    "### Introduction to Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is Reinforcement Learning?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. Unlike other machine learning paradigms, RL focuses on learning through trial and error, receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How RL Differs from Other Machine Learning Paradigms:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Supervised Learning**: \n",
    "   - Learns from labeled examples (input-output pairs)\n",
    "   - The correct answer is provided for each training example\n",
    "   - Example: Image classification, where each image has a label\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Unsupervised Learning**: \n",
    "   - Learns patterns from unlabeled data\n",
    "   - No explicit feedback or correct answers\n",
    "   - Example: Clustering customers based on purchasing behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Reinforcement Learning**: \n",
    "   - Learns from interaction with an environment\n",
    "   - Receives delayed rewards/penalties as feedback\n",
    "   - Must discover which actions yield the most reward through exploration\n",
    "   - Example: Teaching a robot to walk, playing chess, or optimizing ad placement\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Characteristics of RL:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sequential Decision Making**: Actions affect future states and rewards\n",
    "- **Trial and Error**: The agent must explore to discover good strategies\n",
    "- **Delayed Consequences**: Rewards may come long after the actions that caused them\n",
    "- **Trade-offs**: Must balance exploration (trying new things) vs exploitation (using known good strategies)\n",
    "\n",
    "**The RL Loop:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental interaction pattern in RL is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Agent observes the current **state** of the environment\n",
    "2. Agent selects and performs an **action**\n",
    "3. Environment transitions to a new **state**\n",
    "4. Agent receives a **reward** signal\n",
    "5. Repeat\n",

    "Imagine you're in a casino facing a row of slot machines (also called \"one-armed bandits\"). Each machine has a different, unknown probability of paying out. You have a limited budget and want to maximize your total winnings. Which machines should you play?\n",
    "\n",

    "**The Exploration-Exploitation Dilemma**\n",
    "\n",
    "The bandit problem perfectly illustrates the core challenge in RL:\n",
    "\n",

    "- **Exploration**: Try other machines to see if they might be better (gather more information)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you only exploit, you might miss out on better options you haven't tried enough. If you only explore, you waste time on machines you already know are bad. The key is finding the right balance.\n",

    "\n",
    "The simplest approach to the bandit problem is the **greedy strategy**: always choose the action that has the highest estimated value based on your experience so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "1. Keep track of the average reward received from each arm\n",
    "2. Always select the arm with the highest average reward\n",
    "3. Update the average after each pull\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Fatal Flaw:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The greedy strategy can easily get stuck on a suboptimal arm! Here's why:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Suppose you try arm 3 first and get lucky with a high reward\n",
    "- Now arm 3 has the highest estimated value\n",
    "- The greedy strategy will keep choosing arm 3 forever\n",
    "- You'll never discover that arm 7 is actually better!\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called **premature convergence** - the agent stops exploring too early and misses better options.\n",

    "**A Clever Alternative to Epsilon-Greedy**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Optimistic Initial Values approach provides a different solution to encourage exploration. Instead of randomly exploring, it uses **disappointment-driven exploration**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Key Idea:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Initialize all action-value estimates to be **optimistically high** (higher than any realistic reward). When the agent tries an action and receives a lower-than-expected reward, it becomes \"disappointed\" and tries other actions, naturally encouraging exploration.\n",

    "**How It Works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set initial Q-values to a high value (e.g., +5 when true rewards are around 0-1)\n",
    "2. Use a greedy strategy (no epsilon needed!)\n",

    "4. After trying an action, its estimate decreases toward the true value\n",

    "\n",
    "**The Most Sophisticated Bandit Algorithm**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm represents a more principled approach to the exploration-exploitation dilemma. Instead of exploring randomly (epsilon-greedy) or through disappointment (optimistic initialization), UCB explores based on **uncertainty**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Core Principle:**\n",
    "\n",
    "\"It's reasonable to be optimistic in the face of uncertainty.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "UCB selects actions based on both:\n",
    "1. **Estimated value** (exploitation)\n",
    "2. **Uncertainty in that estimate** (exploration)\n",
    "\n",
    "Actions that have been tried less often have higher uncertainty, making them more attractive for exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Formulation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The UCB action selection rule is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$A_t = \\arg\\max_a \\left[ Q_t(a) + c \\sqrt{\\frac{\\ln t}{N_t(a)}} \\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $Q_t(a)$ = estimated value of action $a$ at time $t$ (exploitation term)\n",
    "- $c$ = exploration parameter (controls degree of exploration)\n",
    "- $t$ = current time step (total number of actions taken)\n",
    "- $N_t(a)$ = number of times action $a$ has been selected (uncertainty term)\n",
    "- $\\sqrt{\\frac{\\ln t}{N_t(a)}}$ = uncertainty bonus (larger for less-tried actions)\n",
    "\n",
    "**How the Uncertainty Bonus Works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Actions tried fewer times have larger $\\sqrt{\\frac{\\ln t}{N_t(a)}}$ (more uncertainty)\n",
    "- As an action is tried more, $N_t(a)$ increases and the bonus decreases\n",
    "- The $\\ln t$ term ensures all actions are eventually tried\n",
    "- The bonus naturally balances exploration and exploitation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "- No random exploration - deterministic given the history\n",
    "- Automatically balances exploration and exploitation\n",
    "- Theoretical guarantees on performance (logarithmic regret)\n",
    "- Prioritizes promising actions while ensuring all are tried\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages:**\n",
    "- More complex to implement\n",
    "- Requires tuning the $c$ parameter\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Fundamental RL Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into MDPs, let's clearly define the core concepts that appear in every RL problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Agent**\n",
    "- The learner and decision maker\n",
    "- Observes the environment and takes actions\n",
    "- Goal: Learn a policy that maximizes cumulative reward\n",
    "- Example: A robot, a game-playing AI, a trading algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Environment**\n",
    "- Everything outside the agent\n",
    "- Responds to the agent's actions\n",
    "- Provides observations and rewards\n",
    "- Example: The physical world, a game board, a stock market\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. State (s)**\n",
    "- A representation of the current situation\n",
    "- Contains all relevant information for decision making\n",
    "- Can be fully observable or partially observable\n",
    "- Example: Robot's position and velocity, chess board configuration, account balance\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Action (a)**\n",
    "- A choice the agent can make\n",
    "- Can be discrete (finite set) or continuous (infinite range)\n",
    "- Available actions may depend on the current state\n",
    "- Example: Move left/right, place chess piece, buy/sell/hold\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Reward (r)**\n",
    "- Immediate feedback signal from the environment\n",
    "- Scalar value indicating how good/bad an action was\n",
    "- The agent's goal is to maximize cumulative reward\n",
    "- Example: +1 for reaching goal, -1 for collision, profit/loss amount\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Agent-Environment Interface:**\n",

    "#### Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Mathematical Framework for Reinforcement Learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we understand the basic terminology, let's formalize these concepts using the **Markov Decision Process (MDP)** framework. MDPs provide the mathematical foundation for most reinforcement learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is an MDP?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A Markov Decision Process is a mathematical model for sequential decision-making under uncertainty. It's defined by a tuple $(S, A, P, R, \\gamma)$:\n",
    "\n",
    "**MDP Components:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **$S$: State Space**\n",
    "   - Set of all possible states\n",
    "   - Can be finite (grid positions) or infinite (continuous positions)\n",
    "   - Example: $S = \\{(0,0), (0,1), ..., (4,4)\\}$ for 5×5 grid\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **$A$: Action Space**\n",
    "   - Set of all possible actions\n",
    "   - Can be state-dependent: $A(s)$ = actions available in state $s$\n",
    "   - Example: $A = \\{\\text{UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT}\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **$P$: Transition Probability Function**\n",
    "   - $P(s'|s,a)$ = probability of reaching state $s'$ from state $s$ after taking action $a$\n",
    "   - Defines the dynamics of the environment\n",
    "   - Must satisfy: $\\sum_{s' \\in S} P(s'|s,a) = 1$ for all $s, a$\n",
    "   - Example: In deterministic grid world, $P(s'|s,a) = 1$ for one $s'$ and 0 for others\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **$R$: Reward Function**\n",
    "   - $R(s, a, s')$ = immediate reward for transition from $s$ to $s'$ via action $a$\n",
    "   - Sometimes simplified as $R(s)$ or $R(s,a)$\n",
    "   - Defines the objective the agent should optimize\n",
    "   - Example: $R(s_{goal}) = +10$, $R(s_{other}) = -0.1$\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **$\\gamma$: Discount Factor**\n",
    "   - Value between 0 and 1 that determines importance of future rewards\n",
    "   - $\\gamma = 0$: Only immediate rewards matter (myopic)\n",
    "   - $\\gamma = 1$: All future rewards equally important (far-sighted)\n",
    "   - Typical values: 0.9, 0.95, 0.99\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Markov Property**\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"Markov\" in MDP refers to the **Markov Property** (also called the memoryless property):\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(s_{t+1} | s_t, a_t, s_{t-1}, a_{t-1}, ..., s_0, a_0) = P(s_{t+1} | s_t, a_t)$\n",
    "\n",
    "**In plain English:** The future depends only on the present, not on the past.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is the Markov Property Important?**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tractability**: Makes the problem computationally feasible\n",
    "   - Don't need to remember entire history\n",
    "   - State contains all relevant information\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Simplifies Learning**: Agent only needs to learn from current state\n",
    "   - No need to condition on past states\n",
    "   - Enables dynamic programming and temporal difference learning\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Theoretical Guarantees**: Most RL theory assumes Markov property\n",
    "   - Convergence proofs rely on it\n",
    "   - Optimal policies exist under this assumption\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example - Chess:**\n",
    "- **Markov**: Current board position is the state (contains all relevant info)\n",
    "- **Non-Markov**: Only knowing the last move (need full game history)\n",
    "\n",
    "**When the Markov Property Doesn't Hold:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, many problems are **Partially Observable MDPs (POMDPs)** where:\n",
    "- Agent doesn't see the full state\n",
    "- Must infer state from observations\n",
    "- Example: Robot with limited sensors, poker (can't see opponent's cards)\n",
    "\n",

    "#### Policies: Mapping States to Actions\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is a Policy?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **policy** $\\pi$ is a strategy that defines how the agent behaves - it maps states to actions. The policy is what the agent learns in reinforcement learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types of Policies:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Deterministic Policy**\n",
    "\n",
    "A deterministic policy $\\pi: S \\rightarrow A$ maps each state to a single action:\n",
    "\n",
    "$a = \\pi(s)$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- In grid world: \"Always move RIGHT in state (0,0)\"\n",
    "- In chess: \"Always make the move that captures the most valuable piece\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Stochastic Policy**\n",
    "\n",
    "A stochastic policy $\\pi(a|s)$ gives a probability distribution over actions for each state:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\pi(a|s) = P(A_t = a | S_t = s)$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\sum_a \\pi(a|s) = 1$ for all states $s$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- In grid world: \"Move RIGHT with 70% probability, DOWN with 30% in state (0,0)\"\n",
    "- Epsilon-greedy: \"Take best action with probability 1-ε, random action with probability ε\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Stochastic Policies?**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Exploration**: Randomness helps explore the environment\n",
    "2. **Partial Observability**: When state is uncertain, randomization can help\n",
    "3. **Game Theory**: In competitive settings, randomization prevents exploitation\n",
    "4. **Continuous Actions**: Natural representation for continuous action spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "**Optimal Policy**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **optimal policy** $\\pi^*$ maximizes the expected return from every state:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\pi^* = \\arg\\max_\\pi V^\\pi(s) \\text{ for all } s \\in S$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Theorem:** For any MDP, there exists an optimal deterministic policy!\n",
    "\n",
    "This means we can always find a policy that doesn't need randomness to be optimal (though stochastic policies are still useful during learning).\n",

    "\n",
    "**From Theory to Algorithms**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we understand the Bellman equations, we can use them to solve MDPs! **Dynamic Programming (DP)** methods provide exact solutions when we have perfect knowledge of the environment's dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is Dynamic Programming?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic Programming is a general approach to solving complex problems by:\n",
    "1. Breaking them into simpler subproblems\n",
    "2. Solving each subproblem once\n",
    "3. Storing solutions to avoid recomputation\n",
    "4. Combining solutions to solve the original problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In RL, DP uses the Bellman equations to iteratively compute value functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Assumptions for DP:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Perfect Model**: We know $P(s'|s,a)$ and $R(s,a,s')$ for all states and actions\n",
    "2. **Finite State/Action Spaces**: Can enumerate all states and actions\n",
    "3. **Markov Property**: Future depends only on current state\n",
    "\n",
    "**Two Main DP Algorithms:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Policy Evaluation**: Compute $V^\\pi(s)$ for a given policy $\\pi$\n",
    "2. **Policy Improvement**: Find a better policy given $V^\\pi(s)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining these gives us **Policy Iteration** and **Value Iteration** algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Study DP?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though DP requires perfect knowledge (rarely available in practice), it's important because:\n",
    "- Provides theoretical foundation for RL\n",
    "- Many RL algorithms are approximate DP methods\n",
    "- Helps understand convergence and optimality\n",
    "- Works well for planning problems (e.g., robotics with simulators)\n",

    "- Called \"bootstrapping\" - using estimates to update estimates\n",

    "#### Value Iteration: A More Efficient Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "**Combining Evaluation and Improvement**\n",
    "\n",
    "Policy iteration works well but can be slow because it fully evaluates each policy. **Value iteration** provides a more efficient alternative by combining evaluation and improvement into a single update.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Value Iteration Algorithm:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of alternating between full policy evaluation and improvement, value iteration updates values using the Bellman optimality equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$V_{k+1}(s) = \\max_a \\sum_{s'} P(s'|s,a) \\left[R(s,a,s') + \\gamma V_k(s')\\right]$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithm:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. Initialize V(s) = 0 for all states\n",
    "2. Repeat until convergence:\n",
    "   For each state s:\n",
    "     V(s) ← max_a Σ P(s'|s,a)[R(s,a,s') + γV(s')]\n",
    "3. Extract policy: π(s) = argmax_a Σ P(s'|s,a)[R(s,a,s') + γV(s')]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Differences from Policy Iteration:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **No explicit policy**: Works directly with value function\n",
    "2. **Single update**: Combines evaluation and improvement\n",
    "3. **Faster convergence**: Often requires fewer iterations\n",
    "4. **Simpler implementation**: No need to track policy during iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Value Iteration Works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each update moves V closer to V*\n",
    "- The max operator implicitly improves the policy\n",
    "- Guaranteed to converge to V* (and thus π*)\n",
    "- Convergence rate is exponential in γ\n",
    "\n",
    "**Relationship to Policy Iteration:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Value iteration is like policy iteration with just one sweep of policy evaluation per iteration. Both converge to the same optimal solution, but value iteration is often faster in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's implement value iteration!"

    "\n",
    "Despite the advantages of model-based RL, model-free methods are essential because:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Real-World Complexity**: Most real-world environments are too complex to model accurately\n",
    "   - Human interactions, market dynamics, weather patterns\n",
    "   - High-dimensional, stochastic, non-stationary\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Unknown Dynamics**: Often we don't know how the environment works\n",
    "   - Black-box systems\n",
    "   - Proprietary or inaccessible internals\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model Errors Are Costly**: Wrong models lead to wrong policies\n",
    "   - Model-free methods learn from ground truth\n",
    "   - More robust in practice\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Scalability**: Model-free + function approximation handles large spaces\n",
    "   - Deep RL successes (Atari, Go, robotics)\n",
    "   - Continuous control problems\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Simplicity**: Easier to implement and debug\n",
    "   - Fewer moving parts\n",
    "   - Direct optimization of objective\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Spectrum: Hybrid Approaches**\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern RL often combines both approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dyna**: Model-free learning + model-based planning\n",
    "- **Model-Based RL with Learned Models**: Learn model from data, use for planning\n",
    "- **Imagination-Augmented Agents**: Use model for auxiliary predictions\n",
    "- **World Models**: Learn compact model, train policy in model\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Use Each Approach?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Model-Based RL when:**\n",
    "- You have an accurate model (simulator, known dynamics)\n",
    "- Sample efficiency is critical (expensive interactions)\n",
    "- State space is small enough for planning\n",
    "- You need interpretability\n",
    "- Multiple tasks with same dynamics\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Model-Free RL when:**\n",
    "- Model is unknown or too complex\n",
    "- Environment is high-dimensional\n",
    "- You have abundant data/interactions\n",
    "- Robustness to model errors is important\n",
    "- Simplicity is preferred\n",

    "1. **Episode-Based Learning**: Must wait until episode ends to update values\n",
    "2. **Model-Free**: Don't need to know transition probabilities or rewards\n",
    "3. **Sample-Based**: Learn from actual experience, not from a model\n",

    "**From Prediction to Control: Learning Optimal Policies**\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we've used Monte Carlo methods for **prediction** - evaluating a given policy. Now we'll use MC for **control** - finding the optimal policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Control Problem:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given: An environment (MDP without model)\n",
    "Goal: Find the optimal policy $\\pi^*$ that maximizes expected return\n",
    "\n",
    "**On-Policy Learning:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In **on-policy** learning, we learn about and improve the same policy that we're using to generate behavior. The agent:\n",
    "1. Acts according to policy $\\pi$\n",
    "2. Learns from that experience\n",
    "3. Improves policy $\\pi$\n",
    "4. Repeats\n",
    "\n",
    "This contrasts with **off-policy** learning (covered later), where the agent learns about one policy while following another.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Algorithm: Monte Carlo Control with Epsilon-Greedy**\n",
    "\n",
    "We can't use a purely greedy policy (always exploit) because we need exploration. The solution: **epsilon-greedy exploration**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Idea:** Instead of learning $V(s)$, we learn $Q(s,a)$ (action-values), which tells us the value of taking action $a$ in state $s$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithm Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize**: \n",
    "   - $Q(s,a) = 0$ for all states and actions\n",
    "   - $\\pi$ = epsilon-greedy policy based on $Q$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Repeat** for many episodes:\n",
    "   - **Generate episode** following $\\pi$: $S_0, A_0, R_1, S_1, A_1, R_2, ..., S_T$\n",
    "   - **For each** state-action pair $(s,a)$ in the episode:\n",
    "     - Calculate return $G$ following first visit to $(s,a)$\n",
    "     - Update: $Q(s,a) \\leftarrow \\text{average of returns following } (s,a)$\n",
    "   - **Improve policy**: $\\pi \\leftarrow$ epsilon-greedy with respect to $Q$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Epsilon-Greedy Policy:**\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\pi(a|s) = \\begin{cases}\n",
    "1 - \\epsilon + \\frac{\\epsilon}{|A(s)|} & \\text{if } a = \\arg\\max_{a'} Q(s,a') \\\\\n",
    "\\frac{\\epsilon}{|A(s)|} & \\text{otherwise}\n",
    "\\end{cases}$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Exploration**: Epsilon-greedy ensures all actions are tried\n",
    "2. **Exploitation**: Mostly choose actions with highest Q-values\n",
    "3. **Improvement**: Policy gets better as Q-values become more accurate\n",
    "4. **Convergence**: Under certain conditions, converges to optimal epsilon-greedy policy\n",

    "#### Off-Policy Learning with Importance Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning About One Policy While Following Another**\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we've used **on-policy** learning where we learn about the same policy we're following. But what if we want to:\n",
    "- Learn an optimal (deterministic) policy while exploring (stochastic behavior)?\n",
    "- Learn from data generated by a different policy (e.g., human demonstrations)?\n",
    "- Reuse old experience even after the policy has changed?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where **off-policy** learning comes in!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Target Policy ($\\pi$):**\n",
    "- The policy we want to learn about\n",
    "- Often deterministic and greedy\n",
    "- Example: Always take the best action\n",
    "\n",
    "**Behavior Policy ($b$):**\n",
    "- The policy we actually follow to generate experience\n",
    "- Must be exploratory (try all actions)\n",
    "- Example: Epsilon-greedy or random policy\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Challenge:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Episodes are generated by $b$, but we want to estimate values for $\\pi$. The returns we observe are from $b$'s distribution, not $\\pi$'s!\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Solution: Importance Sampling**\n",
    "\n",
    "Importance sampling is a technique from statistics that allows us to estimate expectations under one distribution using samples from another.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Foundation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to estimate $\\mathbb{E}_\\pi[G_t]$ (expected return under $\\pi$), but we only have samples from $b$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Importance Sampling Ratio:**\n",
    "\n",
    "For a trajectory $\\tau = (S_t, A_t, S_{t+1}, A_{t+1}, ..., S_T)$, the importance sampling ratio is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\rho_{t:T-1} = \\prod_{k=t}^{T-1} \\frac{\\pi(A_k|S_k)}{b(A_k|S_k)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "This ratio weights the return to correct for the difference between policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intuition:**\n",
    "- If $\\pi$ is more likely to take the actions than $b$: ratio > 1 (weight up)\n",
    "- If $\\pi$ is less likely to take the actions than $b$: ratio < 1 (weight down)\n",
    "- If $\\pi$ would never take an action that $b$ took: ratio = 0 (ignore)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Off-Policy MC Prediction with Importance Sampling:**\n",
    "\n",
    "$V(s) = \\frac{\\sum_{t \\in \\mathcal{T}(s)} \\rho_{t:T(t)-1} G_t}{|\\mathcal{T}(s)|}$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathcal{T}(s)$ is the set of all time steps where state $s$ was visited.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Coverage Assumption:**\n",
    "\n",
    "For off-policy learning to work, we need:\n",
    "$\\pi(a|s) > 0 \\implies b(a|s) > 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "In words: The behavior policy must try all actions that the target policy might take.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages of Off-Policy Learning:**\n",
    "1. Can learn optimal policy while exploring\n",
    "2. Can learn from observational data\n",
    "3. Can reuse experience from old policies\n",
    "4. More flexible than on-policy methods\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages:**\n",
    "1. Higher variance (importance sampling ratios can be large)\n",
    "2. Slower convergence\n",
    "3. Requires more data\n",
    "4. Can be unstable if policies are very different\n",

    "\n",
    "**The Variance Problem with Ordinary Importance Sampling**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinary importance sampling (what we just implemented) has a significant problem: **high variance**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why High Variance?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The importance sampling ratio $\\rho = \\prod \\frac{\\pi(a|s)}{b(a|s)}$ can become very large:\n",
    "- If the trajectory is long, many ratios multiply together\n",
    "- If policies differ significantly, individual ratios can be large\n",
    "- A single large ratio can dominate the average\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- Suppose we have 100 episodes with ratio ≈ 1.0\n",
    "- And 1 episode with ratio = 100\n",
    "- The single outlier heavily skews the estimate!\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Solution: Weighted Importance Sampling**\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of a simple average, use a **weighted average** where the weights are the importance sampling ratios themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Formulation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ordinary Importance Sampling:**\n",
    "$V(s) = \\frac{\\sum_{t \\in \\mathcal{T}(s)} \\rho_{t:T(t)-1} G_t}{|\\mathcal{T}(s)|}$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weighted Importance Sampling:**\n",
    "$V(s) = \\frac{\\sum_{t \\in \\mathcal{T}(s)} \\rho_{t:T(t)-1} G_t}{\\sum_{t \\in \\mathcal{T}(s)} \\rho_{t:T(t)-1}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Difference:**\n",
    "- Ordinary: Divide by number of visits\n",
    "- Weighted: Divide by sum of importance ratios\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intuition:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Weighted IS gives more weight to returns with larger importance ratios, but normalizes by the total weight. This:\n",
    "- Reduces the impact of extreme ratios\n",
    "- Provides more stable estimates\n",
    "- Converges faster in practice\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bias-Variance Trade-off:**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Method | Bias | Variance | Convergence |\n",
    "|--------|------|----------|-------------|\n",
    "| Ordinary IS | Unbiased | High | Slower |\n",
    "| Weighted IS | Biased (initially) | Low | Faster |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Note:**\n",
    "- Weighted IS is biased for finite samples\n",
    "- But the bias goes to zero as samples increase\n",
    "- In practice, lower variance usually wins!\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Use Each:**\n",

    "**Understanding When MC Methods Fall Short**\n",
    "\n",
    "While Monte Carlo methods are powerful and model-free, they have significant limitations that restrict their applicability. Understanding these limitations motivates the development of more advanced methods like Temporal Difference learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. The \"Wait Until the End\" Problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Issue:**\n",
    "- MC methods must wait until an episode completes before updating values\n",
    "- No learning happens during the episode\n",
    "- All updates occur at the end\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Matters:**\n",
    "- **Long Episodes**: If episodes take 1000 steps, you wait 1000 steps to learn anything\n",
    "- **Continuing Tasks**: Some tasks never end (e.g., process control, robot operation)\n",
    "- **Slow Feedback**: Can't adjust behavior mid-episode based on what's working\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Episode: S₀ → S₁ → S₂ → ... → S₉₉₉ → S₁₀₀₀ (terminal)\n",
    "         ↑                                    ↑\n",
    "    No learning                         All learning happens here!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Impact:**\n",
    "- Inefficient use of experience\n",
    "- Slow learning, especially with long episodes\n",
    "- Cannot handle continuing (non-episodic) tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. High Variance in Return Estimates**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Issue:**\n",
    "- Returns depend on entire trajectory of rewards\n",
    "- Many random events accumulate\n",
    "- Different episodes from same state can have very different returns\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Perspective:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Return: $G_t = R_{t+1} + \\gamma R_{t+2} + \\gamma^2 R_{t+3} + ...$\n",
    "\n",
    "Each $R_i$ is random, and we're summing many random variables:\n",
    "- More terms → more variance\n",
    "- Longer episodes → higher variance\n",
    "- Stochastic environments → even more variance\n",
    "\n",
    "**Consequences:**\n",
    "- Need many episodes to get accurate estimates\n",
    "- Slow convergence\n",
    "- Unstable learning, especially early on\n",
    "- Off-policy methods (importance sampling) make this worse\n",

    "  \n",

    "**Learning from Every Step**\n",
    "\n",
    "Temporal Difference (TD) learning represents a fundamental breakthrough in reinforcement learning. Unlike Monte Carlo methods that must wait until the end of an episode to update value estimates, TD methods learn from **every single step** of experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Key Insight:**\n",
    "\n",
    "TD learning combines the best aspects of two approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **From Monte Carlo**: Learn directly from experience without a model\n",
    "2. **From Dynamic Programming**: Update estimates based on other estimates (bootstrapping)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why \"Temporal Difference\"?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The name comes from the fact that TD methods learn from the **difference** between estimates at successive **time** steps. Instead of waiting for the actual return, TD methods use the difference between the current estimate and a better estimate based on the next state.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages of TD Learning:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Online Learning**: Update after every step, not just at episode end\n",
    "2. **Lower Variance**: Bootstrap from estimates rather than full returns\n",
    "3. **Works with Continuing Tasks**: No need for episodes to terminate\n",
    "4. **More Sample Efficient**: Learn more from each experience\n",
    "5. **Faster Convergence**: Updates propagate information more quickly\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Trade-off:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **MC**: Unbiased but high variance (uses actual returns)\n",
    "- **TD**: Biased but lower variance (uses estimated returns)\n",
    "- In practice, TD's lower variance usually wins!\n",

    "   - Uses the action A' actually chosen by the policy\n",
    "   - On-policy: learns about the policy being followed\n",
    "   - Conservative: accounts for exploration in learning\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Practical Implementation**:\n",
    "   - Successfully trained agent on Taxi-v3 environment\n",
    "   - Achieved high success rate and efficient navigation\n",
    "   - Demonstrated clear learning progress over episodes\n",
    "   - Learned complex multi-step strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Key Advantages**:\n",
    "   - Model-free: no need to know environment dynamics\n",
    "   - Online learning: updates after every step\n",

    "   - Safe exploration: learns about actual policy behavior\n",

    "\n",
    "In our Q-Learning implementation above, we used a fixed epsilon value (ε = 0.1). This means the agent explores randomly 10% of the time throughout the entire training process. While this works, it's not optimal:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Early in training**: We want MORE exploration to discover good actions\n",
    "- **Late in training**: We want LESS exploration to exploit what we've learned\n",
    "\n",
    "A fixed epsilon means we're either:\n",
    "- Under-exploring early (if ε is too small)\n",
    "- Over-exploring late (if ε is too large)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exploration Schedules: The Solution**\n",
    "\n",
    "An **exploration schedule** (or **epsilon decay**) gradually reduces epsilon over time, allowing the agent to:\n",
    "1. Explore extensively at the beginning\n",
    "2. Gradually shift toward exploitation\n",
    "3. Eventually converge to a near-greedy policy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Epsilon Decay Strategies:**\n",

    "   $$\\epsilon_t = \\epsilon_{start} - \\frac{t}{T}(\\epsilon_{start} - \\epsilon_{end})$$\n",

    "2. **Exponential Decay**: Multiply epsilon by a decay factor each episode\n",
    "   $$\\epsilon_t = \\epsilon_{start} \\cdot \\gamma^t$$\n",
    "   where $\\gamma$ is the decay rate (e.g., 0.995)\n",

    "#### Summary: Epsilon-Decreasing Exploration Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "**What We Learned:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The Problem with Fixed Epsilon**:\n",
    "   - Explores too much late in training (wastes time)\n",
    "   - Or explores too little early in training (misses good actions)\n",
    "   - Doesn't adapt to the learning progress\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Epsilon Decay Strategies**:\n",
    "   - **Linear Decay**: Constant decrease rate, predictable\n",
    "   - **Exponential Decay**: Fast initial decrease, then slower (most common)\n",
    "   - **Step Decay**: Sudden drops at intervals\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Benefits of Epsilon Decay**:\n",
    "   - Better exploration early in training\n",
    "   - Better exploitation late in training\n",
    "   - Faster convergence to optimal policy\n",
    "   - Higher final performance\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Practical Considerations**:\n",
    "   - Start with high epsilon (0.9-1.0) for thorough exploration\n",
    "   - End with small epsilon (0.01-0.05) to maintain some exploration\n",
    "   - Tune decay rate based on problem complexity\n",
    "   - Exponential decay is a good default choice\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **When to Use Each Strategy**:\n",
    "   - **Linear**: When you know training duration and want predictable behavior\n",
    "   - **Exponential**: General-purpose, works well in most scenarios\n",
    "   - **Step**: For curriculum learning or staged training\n",
    "   - **Fixed**: Only for very simple problems or when exploration is critical\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation Tips:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Good starting values for exponential decay\n",
    "epsilon_start = 1.0\n",
    "epsilon_end = 0.01\n",
    "decay_rate = 0.995  # Reaches ~0.01 after ~900 episodes\n",

    "1. **Memory Explosion**: \n",
    "   - A 100×100 grid with 4 actions needs 40,000 entries\n",
    "   - Atari games have ~10^9 possible screen states!\n",
    "   - Continuous state spaces (e.g., robot joint angles) have infinite states\n",

    "2. **No Generalization**:\n",
    "   - Each state is learned independently\n",
    "   - Similar states don't share knowledge\n",
    "   - Must visit every state many times to learn\n",

    "\n",
    "**What is a Deep Q-Network?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A Deep Q-Network (DQN) is a neural network that approximates the Q-function. It was introduced by DeepMind in 2015 and achieved human-level performance on Atari games by learning directly from pixel inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Network Architecture:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic DQN architecture consists of:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input Layer**: Receives the state representation\n",
    "   - For images: Raw pixels or preprocessed frames\n",
    "   - For vectors: State features (position, velocity, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Hidden Layers**: Extract features and learn representations\n",
    "   - Fully connected layers for vector inputs\n",
    "   - Convolutional layers for image inputs\n",
    "   - Activation functions (ReLU is common)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Output Layer**: Produces Q-values for each action\n",
    "   - One output neuron per action\n",
    "   - No activation (linear output)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Formulation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a state $s$, the Q-network computes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Q(s, a; \\theta) = f_{\\theta}(s)_a$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $f_{\\theta}$ is the neural network with parameters $\\theta$\n",
    "- $f_{\\theta}(s)$ outputs a vector of Q-values, one for each action\n",
    "- $f_{\\theta}(s)_a$ is the Q-value for action $a$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Training Objective:**\n",
    "\n",
    "We train the network to minimize the **temporal difference error**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$L(\\theta) = \\mathbb{E}\\left[(r + \\gamma \\max_{a'} Q(s', a'; \\theta) - Q(s, a; \\theta))^2\\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the same TD error from Q-learning, but now we're updating network parameters $\\theta$ instead of table entries!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Architecture Variants:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Simple DQN** (for low-dimensional states):\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   State → FC(64) → ReLU → FC(64) → ReLU → FC(n_actions) → Q-values\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Convolutional DQN** (for image inputs):\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Image → Conv(32,8×8,s=4) → ReLU → Conv(64,4×4,s=2) → ReLU → \n",
    "         → Conv(64,3×3,s=1) → ReLU → FC(512) → ReLU → FC(n_actions) → Q-values\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Dueling DQN** (separates value and advantage):\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   State → Shared Layers → ┬→ Value Stream → V(s)\n",
    "                           └→ Advantage Stream → A(s,a)\n",
    "   Q(s,a) = V(s) + (A(s,a) - mean(A(s,:)))\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Design Choices:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Network Size**: \n",
    "   - Larger networks can represent more complex functions\n",
    "   - But require more data and computation\n",
    "   - Start small and increase if needed\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Activation Functions**:\n",
    "   - ReLU is standard for hidden layers\n",
    "   - No activation on output (Q-values can be any real number)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Output Structure**:\n",
    "   - Output Q-values for ALL actions simultaneously\n",
    "   - More efficient than separate networks per action\n",
    "   - Allows easy action selection: argmax over outputs\n",

    "3. **Key Design Decisions**:\n",
    "   - Network size: Balance capacity vs. sample efficiency\n",
    "   - Depth: Deeper networks for complex patterns\n",
    "   - Initialization: Xavier/He initialization for stable training\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Advantages Over Tabular Methods**:\n",
    "   - **Scalability**: Handle millions of states with thousands of parameters\n",
    "   - **Generalization**: Similar states produce similar Q-values\n",
    "   - **Flexibility**: Can process raw sensory inputs (images, audio)\n",
    "   - **Efficiency**: Share knowledge across similar states\n",

    "\n",
    "**The Problem with Online Learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "When training a Q-network, a naive approach would be to update the network immediately after each interaction with the environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Observe state $s_t$\n",
    "2. Take action $a_t$\n",
    "3. Receive reward $r_t$ and next state $s_{t+1}$\n",
    "4. Immediately update the network using this single transition\n",
    "5. Discard the transition and move on\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Fails:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This online learning approach has several critical problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Correlation Between Consecutive Samples**:\n",
    "   - Sequential experiences are highly correlated\n",
    "   - The agent visits similar states in succession\n",
    "   - Neural networks assume i.i.d. (independent and identically distributed) data\n",
    "   - Correlated samples lead to poor convergence and overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sample Inefficiency**:\n",
    "   - Each experience is used only once for learning\n",
    "   - Gathering experiences can be expensive (especially in real-world scenarios)\n",
    "   - We're throwing away valuable data!\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Catastrophic Forgetting**:\n",
    "   - The network quickly forgets what it learned about earlier states\n",
    "   - As the agent explores new regions, it \"overwrites\" knowledge about previous regions\n",
    "   - This leads to unstable and oscillating behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Solution: Experience Replay**\n",
    "\n",
    "Experience replay, introduced in the original DQN paper (Mnih et al., 2015), solves these problems elegantly:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Idea**: Store past experiences in a **replay buffer** (memory) and randomly sample mini-batches for training.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How It Works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Store**: Save each transition $(s_t, a_t, r_t, s_{t+1}, done_t)$ in a replay buffer\n",
    "2. **Sample**: Randomly sample a mini-batch of transitions from the buffer\n",
    "3. **Learn**: Update the network using the sampled batch\n",
    "4. **Repeat**: Continue storing new experiences and sampling for training\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Experience Replay Works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Breaks Correlation**:\n",
    "   - Random sampling creates i.i.d. training batches\n",
    "   - Transitions from different episodes and time steps are mixed\n",
    "   - Network sees diverse experiences in each update\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Improves Sample Efficiency**:\n",
    "   - Each experience can be used multiple times\n",
    "   - Rare or important experiences aren't immediately forgotten\n",
    "   - Better utilization of collected data\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Stabilizes Learning**:\n",
    "   - Smooths out the learning process\n",
    "   - Reduces variance in updates\n",
    "   - Prevents catastrophic forgetting\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Enables Off-Policy Learning**:\n",
    "   - Can learn from experiences generated by old policies\n",
    "   - Decouples data collection from learning\n",
    "   - More flexible training strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Perspective:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Q-learning update with experience replay:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",

    "- $\\theta$ are the current network parameters\n",
    "- $\\theta^-$ are the target network parameters (we'll cover this next)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practical Considerations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Buffer Size**: Typically 10,000 to 1,000,000 transitions\n",
    "  - Larger buffers provide more diversity but use more memory\n",
    "  - Should be large enough to store experiences from many episodes\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Batch Size**: Usually 32 to 256 transitions\n",
    "  - Larger batches provide more stable gradients\n",
    "  - Smaller batches train faster but with more variance\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sampling Strategy**: Uniform random sampling is most common\n",
    "  - Advanced: Prioritized Experience Replay samples important transitions more often\n",
    "\n",
    "- **When to Start Training**: Wait until buffer has enough samples\n",

    "#### Summary: Experience Replay\n",
    "\n",
    "**What We Learned:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The Problem**:\n",
    "   - Online learning suffers from correlated samples\n",
    "   - Sample inefficiency (each experience used once)\n",
    "   - Catastrophic forgetting of earlier experiences\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The Solution**:\n",
    "   - Store transitions in a replay buffer\n",
    "   - Randomly sample mini-batches for training\n",
    "   - Reuse experiences multiple times\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Key Benefits**:\n",
    "   - **Breaks Correlation**: Random sampling creates i.i.d. batches\n",
    "   - **Sample Efficiency**: Each experience used multiple times\n",
    "   - **Stability**: Smooths learning, reduces variance\n",
    "   - **Off-Policy**: Can learn from old experiences\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Implementation Details**:\n",
    "   - Use `deque` with `maxlen` for automatic capacity management\n",
    "   - Store complete transitions: $(s, a, r, s', done)$\n",
    "   - Random sampling with `random.sample()`\n",
    "   - Batch preparation for efficient training\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Practical Guidelines**:\n",
    "   - Buffer size: 10,000 - 1,000,000 transitions\n",
    "   - Batch size: 32 - 256 transitions\n",
    "   - Start training after buffer has enough samples\n",
    "   - Larger buffers = more diversity, more memory\n",
    "\n",
    "**Impact on Deep RL:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Experience replay was a crucial innovation that made DQN work. Without it:\n",
    "- Training is unstable and often diverges\n",
    "- Sample efficiency is poor\n",
    "- Performance is significantly worse\n",
    "\n",
    "With experience replay:\n",
    "- DQN can learn from pixels to play Atari games\n",
    "- Training is stable and reliable\n",
    "- Sample efficiency is greatly improved\n",

    "#### Target Networks for Stable Training\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Moving Target Problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "When training a Q-network, we face a fundamental instability issue. Recall the Q-learning update:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "Q(s, a) \\leftarrow Q(s, a) + \\alpha \\left[ r + \\gamma \\max_{a'} Q(s', a') - Q(s, a) \\right]\n",

    "The problem: We're using the **same network** to:\n",
    "1. Estimate the current Q-value: $Q(s, a)$\n",
    "2. Estimate the target Q-value: $r + \\gamma \\max_{a'} Q(s', a')$\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates a **moving target problem**:\n",
    "- Every time we update the network, we change both the prediction AND the target\n",
    "- It's like trying to hit a target that moves every time you adjust your aim\n",
    "- This leads to oscillations, divergence, and unstable training\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Target Network Solution**\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution is to use **two separate networks**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Online Network** (parameters $\\theta$): Updated every step, used to select actions\n",
    "2. **Target Network** (parameters $\\theta^-$): Updated infrequently, used to compute targets\n",
    "\n",
    "The modified update becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\text{Loss} = \\mathbb{E}_{(s,a,r,s') \\sim \\mathcal{D}} \\left[ \\left( r + \\gamma \\max_{a'} Q_{\\theta^-}(s', a') - Q_\\theta(s, a) \\right)^2 \\right]\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $Q_\\theta$ is the online network (being trained)\n",
    "- $Q_{\\theta^-}$ is the target network (held fixed)\n",
    "- $\\mathcal{D}$ is the replay buffer\n",
    "\n",
    "**How Target Networks Work:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize both networks with the same weights: $\\theta^- = \\theta$\n",
    "2. For many steps:\n",
    "   - Use online network to select actions and compute current Q-values\n",
    "   - Use target network to compute target Q-values\n",
    "   - Update only the online network\n",
    "3. Periodically (e.g., every 1000 steps): $\\theta^- \\leftarrow \\theta$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The target network provides **stable targets** for many updates\n",
    "- The online network can learn without chasing a moving target\n",
    "- Periodic updates ensure the target network eventually catches up\n",
    "- This dramatically improves training stability\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Hyperparameters:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Update Frequency**: How often to copy weights (e.g., every 1000-10000 steps)\n",
    "- **Soft Updates** (alternative): $\\theta^- \\leftarrow \\tau \\theta + (1-\\tau) \\theta^-$ with small $\\tau$ (e.g., 0.001)\n",

    "1. **Learning Curve**: The agent starts with poor performance (random actions) and gradually improves as it learns\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Exploration vs Exploitation**: \n",
    "   - Early episodes: High epsilon → more exploration → variable performance\n",
    "   - Later episodes: Low epsilon → more exploitation → stable high performance\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Target Network Impact**:\n",
    "   - Training is stable without wild oscillations\n",
    "   - Loss decreases smoothly over time\n",
    "   - The agent converges to a good policy\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Experience Replay Benefits**:\n",
    "   - Efficient use of past experiences\n",

    "2. **Evaluating** that action: $Q(s', a')$",
    "",
    "This creates a **maximization bias**: if the Q-values have any estimation errors (which they always do), the max operation will tend to select actions with positive errors, leading to systematic overestimation.",

    "#### Analysis: Why Double DQN Works Better",
    "",
    "**Key Observations from the Comparison:**",
    "",
    "1. **Q-Value Estimates**:",
    "   - Standard DQN typically shows higher Q-values, indicating overestimation",
    "   - Double DQN produces more conservative, accurate Q-value estimates",
    "   - This is evidence of the overestimation bias being reduced",
    "",
    "2. **Learning Stability**:",
    "   - Double DQN often shows smoother learning curves",
    "   - Less variance in performance across episodes",
    "   - More consistent convergence to good policies",
    "",
    "3. **Final Performance**:",
    "   - Double DQN frequently achieves better or equal final performance",
    "   - The improvement is more pronounced in complex environments",
    "   - CartPole is relatively simple, so differences may be subtle",
    "",
    "4. **Computational Cost**:",
    "   - Double DQN has virtually no additional computational cost",
    "   - Same network architecture and training time",
    "   - Only the update rule changes slightly",
    "",
    "**When Does Double DQN Help Most?**",
    "",
    "Double DQN provides the biggest benefits when:",
    "- The environment has stochastic rewards or transitions",
    "- The action space is large",
    "- Q-value estimation is noisy",
    "- Long-term planning is important",
    "",
    "**Practical Recommendations:**",
    "",
    "✅ **Use Double DQN** as your default choice - it's strictly better than standard DQN with no downsides",
    "",
    "✅ **Combine with other improvements** like:",
    "   - Prioritized Experience Replay",
    "   - Dueling Networks",
    "   - Noisy Networks for exploration",
    "",
    "✅ **Monitor Q-values** during training to detect overestimation issues",
    "",
    "**Mathematical Insight:**",
    "",
    "The key insight is that by decoupling action selection from evaluation, we reduce the positive bias:",
    "",
    "$",
    "\\mathbb{E}[\\max_a Q(s,a)] \\geq \\max_a \\mathbb{E}[Q(s,a)]",
    "$",
    "",
    "This inequality (Jensen's inequality for the max function) shows that taking the max of noisy estimates gives a biased result. Double DQN mitigates this by using independent estimates.",
    "",
    "**Next Steps:**",
    "",
    "Double DQN is a foundational improvement to DQN. Modern deep RL often combines it with other techniques like:",
    "- **Dueling DQN**: Separate value and advantage streams",
    "- **Prioritized Replay**: Sample important transitions more frequently  ",
    "- **Rainbow DQN**: Combines multiple improvements into one algorithm",
    "",
    "In the next sections, we'll explore policy gradient methods, which take a fundamentally different approach to RL!"
